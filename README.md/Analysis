•	The weather shifts prominently warmer as we near around the equator. Besides, the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere. This is may be because of the angle of the earth.
•	There is no strong relationship between latitude and humidity as I can see from the graph. However, it is interesting to see that a line of a band of cities sits at 0, 20, 40, ~70, 90, and 100% humidity.
•	There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. However, in northern hemispheres, the majority of cities wind is 0 mpg to 20 mpg.
